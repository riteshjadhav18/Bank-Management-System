Project Title: Automated Teller Machine (ATM) System

Project Description:
The Automated Teller Machine (ATM) System project aims to develop a user-friendly and secure platform that enables bank customers to perform a variety of financial transactions conveniently and efficiently. The system will replicate the essential functionalities of a real-world ATM, providing users with a seamless and secure experience for their banking needs.

Key Features:

User Authentication: The system will require users to input a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) for authentication. Additionally, biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition can be integrated to enhance security.

Account Information: Upon successful authentication, users can view their account balances, recent transactions, and other account-related information.

Cash Withdrawal: Users can request cash withdrawals by specifying the desired amount. The system will verify the availability of funds and dispense the requested amount if possible.

Deposit Functionality: Users can deposit cash or checks into their accounts. The system will validate the deposit and update the account balance accordingly.

Fund Transfers: The system will allow users to transfer funds between their own accounts or to other linked accounts within the same bank. Recipient accounts will be verified before processing the transfer.

Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balances at any time during their session.

Change PIN: Users will have the option to change their PIN for added security.

Receipts: The system will provide electronic receipts for transactions, which can be printed or sent via email if desired by the user.

Security Measures: The system will incorporate multiple layers of security, including encryption of data transmissions, timed session logouts, and integration with the bank's security infrastructure.

Accessibility: The user interface will be designed to accommodate various user needs, ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities.

Technology Stack:
The ATM System will be developed using a combination of technologies including:

Programming Languages: Java, Advance java
Database Management: MySQL

Project Goals:

Develop a user-friendly and intuitive interface that can be navigated easily by customers of all technical backgrounds.
Ensure the security of sensitive customer data and transactions through robust encryption and authentication methods.
Provide a reliable and efficient transaction processing system that accurately reflects account balances and transaction histories.
Implement comprehensive error handling to address scenarios such as failed transactions, insufficient funds, and network disruptions.
Enhance accessibility features to make the system usable by a diverse range of customers.
Conclusion:
The Automated Teller Machine (ATM) System project seeks to create a robust, secure, and user-friendly platform that emulates the functionalities of a real-world ATM. By incorporating essential features such as user authentication, transaction processing, and security measures, this project aims to provide a valuable tool for both banks and their customers, simplifying financial interactions and enhancing the overall banking experience.
